# Asteroids - Classic Arcade Game Recreation
## 🚀 **V1.0 RELEASE** - Professional-Quality Game Complete!

A modern recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built in C++ with Raylib. Features professional-quality audio, particle effects, high score persistence, pause functionality, and polished gameplay while maintaining the authentic retro feel.

## 🤖 **AI-Assisted Learning Project**

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE:** This project was created **primarily using GitHub Copilot Agent mode** as a learning exercise in game development, C++ programming, and AI-assisted coding. While I (the repository owner) made design decisions, provided feedback, and performed some manual tweaks, **the vast majority of the source code was generated by AI**.
>
> **This is NOT presented as hand-written code** - it's a demonstration of:
> - AI-assisted game development workflows
> - Learning C++ and game programming concepts through AI collaboration
> - Exploring what's possible with modern AI coding tools
> - Understanding game architecture through guided AI development
>
> If you're looking for examples of traditional hand-coded games, this repository may not be suitable. However, if you're interested in AI-assisted development processes or learning game programming concepts, this project demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration in software development.
