# Asteroids - Classic Arcade Game Recreation

A modern recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built in C++ with Raylib. Features professional-quality audio, particle effects, and polished gameplay while maintaining the authentic retro feel.

## 🤖 **AI-Assisted Learning Project**

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE:** This project was created **primarily using GitHub Copilot Agent mode** as a learning exercise in game development, C++ programming, and AI-assisted coding. While I (the repository owner) made design decisions, provided feedback, and performed some manual tweaks, **the vast majority of the source code was generated by AI**.
>
> **This is NOT presented as hand-written code** - it's a demonstration of:
> - AI-assisted game development workflows
> - Learning C++ and game programming concepts through AI collaboration
> - Exploring what's possible with modern AI coding tools
> - Understanding game architecture through guided AI development
>
> If you're looking for examples of traditional hand-coded games, this repository may not be suitable. However, if you're interested in AI-assisted development processes or learning game programming concepts, this project demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration in software development.

## 🚀 Features

## 🏆 Development Philosophy & Learning Approach

This AI-assisted project demonstrates:
- **Human-AI Collaboration** - Strategic decisions by human, implementation by AI
- **Iterative Development** - Continuous feedback and refinement cycles
- **Learning Through Guidance** - Understanding concepts through AI-generated examples
- **Quality Through AI** - Leveraging AI for professional-grade code structure

### Traditional Development Values Maintained:
- **Authentic retro experience** with modern polish
- **Clean, maintainable code** architecture  
- **Performance and stability** over feature bloat
- **Professional quality** with attention to detail

### AI Development Process:
1. **Human defines requirements** and provides feedback
2. **AI implements features** with proper architecture
3. **Human tests and refines** through iterative feedback
4. **AI handles technical details** while human guides direction
